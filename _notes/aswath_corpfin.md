# Corporate Finance – Aswath Damodaran

This course can be found in full on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2BorqnDenjSLZ2DHIXrdxoN4Bn_). It consists of 36 videos, each around 20 minutes in length. The notes herein are a summarised version of Damodaran's course, for my personal reference.

## Introduction

We can view a company from the perspective of an accounting balance sheet (backwards looking), or a financial balance sheet.
  - Assets consist of assets in place, the existing investments that currently generate cash flow, and growth assets.
  - Liabilities consist of debt (first claim on cash flows), and equity. 

Corporate finance is about maximising the value of a firm. There are three broad decisions any company (regardless of size, sector, location) has to make:

- The **Investment Decision**: return on assets should be greater than a minimum acceptable hurdle rate
  - the hurdle rate should reflect the riskiness of the investment and the debt/equity mix (i.e how it is funded)
  - the return is a function of the magnitude and timing of cash flows. 
- The **Financing Decision**: choose a debt/equity mix that maximises firm value, e.g by choosing debt that matches the tenor of your assets. 
- The **Dividend Decision**: if you can't find investments that meet the hurdle rate, you should return cash via dividends or buybacks.

In practice, because the "value of a firm" is unobservable, stock price is used as a proxy. However, using stock price maximisation as the sole objective of corporate finance requires a number of assumptions:

- Equity holders have the power to change management -- hence management's goal is to maximise their wealth)
  - in reality, shareholders may not use their proxy rights 
  - managers can build in poison pills, golden parachutes, or overpay on takeovers. All at the cost of shareholders.
  - post-war Germany and Japan managed this by having a cross-holding system, where other managers remove bad managers.
- Managers don't abuse their lenders -- otherwise they would try to give to equity holders at the lenders' cost (e.g the LBO of RJR Nabisco)
- Markets are efficient and management does not misinform the public - so that stock price is a proxy for value
  - many traders trade on short term prospects
  - many companies delay/spin bad news as possible.
- There are no social costs -- this is a completely untrue assumption, e.g Amazon's workers.

## Hurdle rates

*This section is essentially about estimating the cost of capital. Please see the notes on [Valuation]({{ site.url }}/notes/aswath_valuation) for this.*

## Measuring investment returns

- Revenues are booked using **accrual accounting** - revenues are shown when the goods/services are exchanged, not when you receive payment.
- You can convert to cash accounting by adding back non-cash expenses, but subtracting capex and the change in working capital.
- The ideal measure of return is a **time-weighted incremental cash flow return**, and this should be compared to the hurdle rate of the investment (not the WACC of the company, although you can fall back on the WACC).
  - incremental means that we ignore sunk costs and add back expenses that would be there regardless of the investment
- In practice, we would invest in projects if the NPV (using the hurdle rate to discount cash flows) is greater than zero, or if the IRR greater than the cost of capital.
  - often it is fair to use the growing perpetuity formula for long term projects 
  - the NPV calculation assumes that earlier cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas the IRR assumes that earlier cash flows are reinvested at the IRR. 
- a project might have multiple IRRs if the cash flow profile is nonstandard (i.e some negative cash flows in later years).
