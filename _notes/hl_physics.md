## About the notes

While these notes were for the exams in 2015, I think they might still be applicable for the syllabus starting in 2016. This is because, while I did have the syllabus beside me when I was making the notes, in the end I decided not to follow the same format as the syllabus. Instead, I grouped similar sections and put them in a logical order.

The notes are more-or-less complete, but that being said in some cases I may have neglected obvious points. Make sure you check your syllabus to ensure that you are covered. In some cases, I have included derivations (or maths) beyond the syllabus, e.g. I mention differential equations a few times (which sadly aren't on our HL maths syllabus either). I did this because I find the maths much more intuitive and it helps me to understand better. Some people prefer a purely conceptual understanding, and that's fine for IB.

The notes are not in the same order as the syllabus, because the syllabus order doesn't flow well (because they have to make it usable for the SL people as well). The order of the topics I've done can be seen in the 'cover page and contents' pdf, but I'll put it here too.

## Some other points

- Apologies for my handwriting, it should be legible though.
- Sorry for the ugly font in the Energy Power Climate notes. Some study I was reading showed that some particular font types aided the memory. Whether or not you believe in the power of the human sciences…
- With regard to errors in the notes, I apologise for grammatical mistakes. There shouldn't be many mistakes in the physics, though I'd bet that I screwed up the polarity of something somewhere.
- Remember, these notes are just meant to be a bit of help, I would still suggest making your own notes as well as doing as many past papers you can get your hands on.
