I'm Robert. I'm a jaded physicist now working at a hedge fund. I'm interested in understanding complex systems, using both quantitative and qualitative tools. I love learning and meta-learning (trying to improve my learning systems)!

<!-- I am interested in finding intuitive quantitative explanations for complex phenomena, even if those intuitive explanations concede a lack of determinism. It's always nice to find order in complexity, but it may very well be complex all the way down. I'm a logical person who holds rationality dear, though I'm equally interested in the limits of rationality and the need to make decisions under epistemic uncertainty, accounting for "model risk".

There was a time when I wanted to be a physicist, but "messy" systems like financial markets attract my attention nowadays. You can't understand these systems on a blackboard; you have to get your hands dirty and dive into the data. Programming is a key weapon in this endeavour. -->
